CodeBook for the tidy dataset
=============================
+Data source
+-----------
+This dataset is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made avaiable here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
+Feature Selection
+-----------------
+I refer you to the README and features.txt files in the original dataset to learn more about the feature selection for this dataset.
+
+In short, for this derived dataset, these signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
+'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
+
+tBodyAcc-XYZ
+tGravityAcc-XYZ
+tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
+tBodyGyro-XYZ
+tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
+tBodyAccMag
+tGravityAccMag
+tBodyAccJerkMag
+tBodyGyroMag
+tBodyGyroJerkMag
+fBodyAcc-XYZ
+fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
+fBodyGyro-XYZ
+fBodyAccMag
+fBodyAccJerkMag
+fBodyGyroMag
+fBodyGyroJerkMag
+
+The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:
+
+mean(): Mean value
+std(): Standard deviation
+
+Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
+
+gravityMean
+tBodyAccMean
+tBodyAccJerkMean
+tBodyGyroMean
+tBodyGyroJerkMean
+
+Other estimates have been removed for the purpose of this excercise.
+
+Note: features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
